large","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["58",{"pageContent":"to large language models so what you can do with large","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["59",{"pageContent":"with large language models is all of a sudden a much

now","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["62",{"pageContent":"okay now let's have a look at how we can Implement all of this","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["63",{"pageContent":"all of this okay so we're going to be installing a few","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["64",{"pageContent":"a few prerequisites here so we're we have the hook and face","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["65",{"pageContent":"and face datasets library because we already have a Lex","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["66",{"pageContent":"have a Lex Friedman transcripts data set that we're going","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["67",{"pageContent":"we're going to use although I will talk about how to","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["68",{"pageContent":"about how to actually get that in another video we have this","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["69",{"pageContent":"we have this pod gbt Library which is actually how we get","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["70",{"pageContent":"how we get that I'll create that data set and it's also how","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["71",{"pageContent":"also how we're going to index everything into Pinecone","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["72",{"pageContent":"Pinecone yeah pankan here we're using grpc client I","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["73",{"pageContent":"client I actually I'm not sure if we do need that here but","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["74",{"pageContent":"here but generally speaking we can use this to make things","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["75",{"pageContent":"make things faster then we have langjang open Ai and tqdm","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["76",{"pageContent":"Ai and tqdm which is just the progress bar Okay cool so we get","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["77",{"pageContent":"so we get to here you will need a few API keys so you have your","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["78",{"pageContent":"have your open AI API key that is at platform.openai.com","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["79",{"pageContent":"you have your Pinecone API key for that you go to","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["80",{"pageContent":"you go to app.pinecone.io and then you if you have an","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["81",{"pageContent":"you have an account you'll see this screen otherwise you","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["82",{"pageContent":"you will need to sign up for an account and you go to API keys","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["83",{"pageContent":"to API keys and just copy that and also note that here this is","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["84",{"pageContent":"here this is the environment Us West one gcp I would paste in","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["85",{"pageContent":"paste in my API key here and here I'd put us West one gcp right","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["86",{"pageContent":"gcp right okay cool now let's move on to this so we're going","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["87",{"pageContent":"we're going to download that data set I'm not sure plus","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["88",{"pageContent":"sure plus actually the correct name let's try okay so let me","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["89",{"pageContent":"so let me change the data set name okay I can see at the top","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["90",{"pageContent":"at the top here so change column let's transcripts so I'm","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["91",{"pageContent":"so I'm going to put that in there try again and let me let me","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["92",{"pageContent":"let me let me just see what I'm doing wrong so I'm going to","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["93",{"pageContent":"I'm going to copy this oh I put ask for transcript sorry Lex","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["94",{"pageContent":"sorry Lex transcripts okay so that is downloaded there's","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["95",{"pageContent":"there's not a ton of data in there at the moment I'm actually","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["96",{"pageContent":"actually I'm processing more of that at the moment so","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["97",{"pageContent":"moment so hopefully by the time you see this video this will","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["98",{"pageContent":"this will be bigger and you'll you'll have more data in","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["99",{"pageContent":"more data in there which will give you more interesting","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["100",{"pageContent":"results and then we need to reformat this data into a format","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["101",{"pageContent":"a format that is required by the Pod GPT indexer now if you","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["102",{"pageContent":"now if you saw my recent video on chat GPT plugins you'll","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["103",{"pageContent":"you'll recognize that this is kind of it's it's very","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["104",{"pageContent":"it's very similar to the format that they use of chat gbt","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["105",{"pageContent":"of chat gbt plugins the reason I've done it on purpose","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["106",{"pageContent":"on purpose because I also want to show you at some point not","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["107",{"pageContent":"point not in this video but in another video how we can","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["108",{"pageContent":"how we can create a chat gbt plugin using this pretty much","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["109",{"pageContent":"pretty much the same approach right so we have our IDs we","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["110",{"pageContent":"our IDs we have the text and then we have metadata and in","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["111",{"pageContent":"and in there we have just relevant information so I want","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["112",{"pageContent":"so I want basically what I want the model to refer to the","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["113",{"pageContent":"refer to the title of the podcast episodes and also link","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["114",{"pageContent":"also link back to them so that's why I have those two in the in","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["115",{"pageContent":"two in the in the metadata there okay so let me run that and","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["116",{"pageContent":"run that and then we need to initialize our indexer object","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["117",{"pageContent":"object that we need to actually import GPT needs to","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["118",{"pageContent":"GPT needs to obviously have the open AI API key in there as","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["119",{"pageContent":"in there as well okay its name that should work cool and then","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["120",{"pageContent":"and then what we're going to do is actually just add","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["121",{"pageContent":"just add everything in there so we're going to go through","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["122",{"pageContent":"go through each row in our data which represents a single

zero","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["124",{"pageContent":"to data zero there's probably going to be a lot of text in","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["125",{"pageContent":"of text in here right because it's an entire podcast is here","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["126",{"pageContent":"is here right we have all of this and this is actually just a","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["127",{"pageContent":"just a podcast clip right if it's a full podcast it's going","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["128",{"pageContent":"it's going to be even longer okay this is Lex um doing a song","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["129",{"pageContent":"doing a song apparently another short video I'm going to","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["130",{"pageContent":"I'm going to try and find Once long okay this looks more like","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["131",{"pageContent":"more like podcast line right you see there's a ton of text in","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["132",{"pageContent":"of text in here yeah so this is it's an early podcast as well","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["133",{"pageContent":"as well so maybe it's not even that long compared to some of","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["134",{"pageContent":"to some of the more recent ones but basically we're not","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["135",{"pageContent":"we're not going to feed all of that into a single embedding","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["136",{"pageContent":"embedding because we want to be more specific with our","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["137",{"pageContent":"with our embeddings so the automatic uh processing here of","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["138",{"pageContent":"here of the the indexer is actually to split

to","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["141",{"pageContent":"going to reformatical loads converting this into

source","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["149",{"pageContent":"to be source try okay so it was actually supposed to be","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["150",{"pageContent":"to be Source there okay so I think this bit here I don't","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["151",{"pageContent":"here I don't actually need to do I think this is actually","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["152",{"pageContent":"is actually handled by pod GPT so let's remove that

it's","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["154",{"pageContent":"bit it's processing everything uh if I would like to see","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["155",{"pageContent":"like to see where that is then I mean it should come up

this","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["160",{"pageContent":"when is this this is just now yeah all right so let me make","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["161",{"pageContent":"let me make that a little bit longer okay it doesn't let

using","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["207",{"pageContent":"we're using the GPT 3.5 turbo model you can also just do that","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["208",{"pageContent":"just do that basically the GPT 3.5 turbo is the default","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["209",{"pageContent":"the default model name setting for that okay cool now what","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["210",{"pageContent":"now what we want to do is we're going to be using this","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["211",{"pageContent":"using this retrieval QA object so recently Lang

we","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["213",{"pageContent":"and now we use this rather than vector dbqa okay so it's","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["214",{"pageContent":"okay so it's basically pretty much the same thing right","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["215",{"pageContent":"thing right it's just using a slightly different approach","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["216",{"pageContent":"approach okay so we specify the large language model that","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["217",{"pageContent":"model that we'd like to use we are specifying the chain type","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["218",{"pageContent":"chain type so we'll I'll talk about it and then the","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["219",{"pageContent":"and then the retriever so that is just a vector DB and then","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["220",{"pageContent":"DB and then the method we say as retriever to turn into","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["221",{"pageContent":"to turn into basically a retrieval object right so yeah we","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["222",{"pageContent":"so yeah we have this chain type stuff here we have two","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["223",{"pageContent":"we have two options we have either stuff or we have a map","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["224",{"pageContent":"we have a map reduce okay let's say we return 10 items if we","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["225",{"pageContent":"items if we use chain type stuff those 10 documents are just","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["226",{"pageContent":"are just returned as is and they're passed to the large","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["227",{"pageContent":"to the large language model if we use mapreduce those are 10","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["228",{"pageContent":"those are 10 items are summarize and that summary is then","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["229",{"pageContent":"is then passed into the large language model we want as much","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["230",{"pageContent":"want as much information as possible coming from our","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["231",{"pageContent":"from our Vector database so we use a self chain type okay","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["232",{"pageContent":"type okay initialize that cool now we get to the kind of","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["233",{"pageContent":"the kind of interesting stuff right so we have our","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["234",{"pageContent":"we have our Retriever with all this we could do like the","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["235",{"pageContent":"do like the naive implementation of using a vector","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["236",{"pageContent":"a vector database with a lounge model where we're using","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["237",{"pageContent":"we're using like we have a query we pass it to the plus","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["238",{"pageContent":"to the plus language model we use that query to also search","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["239",{"pageContent":"also search effects database and retrieve that","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["240",{"pageContent":"that information and feed it into the query or into the","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["241",{"pageContent":"or into the prompt alongside the query for the large","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["242",{"pageContent":"the large language model that's like the simple way

every","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["244",{"pageContent":"every single time but obviously in like a chat scenario","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["245",{"pageContent":"scenario you're not necessarily going to want to refer

every","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["247",{"pageContent":"with every single interaction so by using these agents and","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["248",{"pageContent":"agents and these tools we can just do it when is needed","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["249",{"pageContent":"is needed according to the largest language model right","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["250",{"pageContent":"model right but to do that we need to create this tool okay so","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["251",{"pageContent":"tool okay so this is basically a vector database as a tool","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["252",{"pageContent":"as a tool right so we're going to give a tool description","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["253",{"pageContent":"that tool description is used by the model or the large","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["254",{"pageContent":"or the large language model to decide which of its tools it","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["255",{"pageContent":"its tools it should use because sometimes it can have","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["256",{"pageContent":"it can have multiple tools and it's also just to decide if it","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["257",{"pageContent":"decide if it needs to use in this case this one tool that it","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["258",{"pageContent":"tool that it has right so this needs to be descriptive and","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["259",{"pageContent":"and very like just straightforward right so here we're","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["260",{"pageContent":"here we're saying use this tool to answer user questions","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["261",{"pageContent":"questions using Lex freedom and podcasts if the user says","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["262",{"pageContent":"user says as collects use this tool to get the answer

questions","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["264",{"pageContent":"questions from the user right so I kind of wanted to add this","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["265",{"pageContent":"to add this so that it's not expecting us to say ass collects","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["266",{"pageContent":"collects every time okay for the first query fine but then","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["267",{"pageContent":"but then after that maybe I want to ask a follow-up question","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["268",{"pageContent":"question without saying ask collapse again okay and then","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["269",{"pageContent":"and then we initialize a tool from langchain Agents so","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["270",{"pageContent":"Agents so tools require three items they require a","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["271",{"pageContent":"require a function right so in that that function","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["272",{"pageContent":"function basically takes in some text input it does","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["273",{"pageContent":"it does something and then it outputs some text output okay","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["274",{"pageContent":"output okay that is what the function needs to be and that is","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["275",{"pageContent":"and that is this retriever.run okay so that's the","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["276",{"pageContent":"that's the retrieval QA object that we've created up here","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["277",{"pageContent":"up here okay cool now we have the tool description which we","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["278",{"pageContent":"which we defined here and we have the name of the tool as well","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["279",{"pageContent":"tool as well so Lex Friedman database so with all of that","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["280",{"pageContent":"all of that we're ready to move on to initializing our

now","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["282",{"pageContent":"agent now because it's a conversational agent it does","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["283",{"pageContent":"it does require some form of memory so

to","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["285",{"pageContent":"going to use a very simple one here so

what","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["290",{"pageContent":"on on what you're looking for so basically this is going

we","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["302",{"pageContent":"right we need it to be chat history because we will be","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["303",{"pageContent":"we will be feeding this into the prompt later on and the","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["304",{"pageContent":"on and the prompt is going to use the the input or the the","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["305",{"pageContent":"or the the parameter chat history so that is important

our","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["307",{"pageContent":"our conversational agent now let's take a look at this so in","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["308",{"pageContent":"at this so in here we have our initialize agent we have the","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["309",{"pageContent":"we have the type of agent there are a ton of different

so","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["313",{"pageContent":"bot right so that means it's going to be using","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["314",{"pageContent":"to be using conversational memory we are using the react","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["315",{"pageContent":"the react framework which is basically like a almost like a","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["316",{"pageContent":"like a thought Loop for the larger language model which

we're","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["320",{"pageContent":"okay we're going to talk about that a lot more in a lot more","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["321",{"pageContent":"in a lot more depth relatively soon but for now I'm not going","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["322",{"pageContent":"not going to go into too much detail there but it's","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["323",{"pageContent":"but it's basically that reasoning action reasoning","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["324",{"pageContent":"reasoning action Loop and then description so the","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["325",{"pageContent":"so the description is referring to you know we we have that","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["326",{"pageContent":"we have that tool description up here that is basically the","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["327",{"pageContent":"the deciding factor of the large language model on

in","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["329",{"pageContent":"has that in there as well in here we're passing in the number","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["330",{"pageContent":"the number the tools I can use right there can be multiple","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["331",{"pageContent":"be multiple tools we've just got one now here uh we have our","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["332",{"pageContent":"we have our large language model verbose is basically","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["333",{"pageContent":"basically because what that man we're developing we're","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["334",{"pageContent":"we're trying to figure out you know what we need to do here we","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["335",{"pageContent":"to do here we want to see every step in the execution of this","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["336",{"pageContent":"of this agent okay every every step in the Asian executed","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["337",{"pageContent":"executed chain that's going to print out so we can see what","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["338",{"pageContent":"can see what is actually happening matched iterations is","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["339",{"pageContent":"is saying okay so especially when you have multiple tools","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["340",{"pageContent":"tools what might happen is that your agent is like okay I","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["341",{"pageContent":"like okay I need to use this tool I'm going to use it it gets an","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["342",{"pageContent":"it it gets an answer and it's going to think okay I need to use","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["343",{"pageContent":"I need to use other tool to complement this answer and I need","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["344",{"pageContent":"and I need to use another tool I need to use another tool

going","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["346",{"pageContent":"keep going like infinitely or just for too long okay so we","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["347",{"pageContent":"okay so we want to put a stop on the number of iterations I can","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["348",{"pageContent":"I can go through there number of Loops it can go through so we","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["349",{"pageContent":"so we set that to two we have our early stopping method here","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["350",{"pageContent":"method here so basically the the model can decide okay I'm","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["351",{"pageContent":"okay I'm done stop right and then we also have that","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["352",{"pageContent":"have that conversational memory okay very important cool","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["353",{"pageContent":"cool now we like we basically have almost everything set up","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["354",{"pageContent":"set up we just need to set up a final thing is kind of clean up","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["355",{"pageContent":"of clean up the prompt and also just understand the problem","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["356",{"pageContent":"the problem because the The Prompt for the conversational","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["357",{"pageContent":"agent is actually pretty complicated all right so uh first","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["358",{"pageContent":"so uh first let's just have a look at the default prompt that","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["359",{"pageContent":"prompt that we get so we come to here and we have the chat","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["360",{"pageContent":"the chat prompt template uh it's kind of hard to read but we","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["361",{"pageContent":"read but we basically have this system message

large","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["363",{"pageContent":"is a large language model trained by open AI so it's","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["364",{"pageContent":"AI so it's designed to assist with large range of tasks so on","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["365",{"pageContent":"tasks so on and so on right this is I think this is quite a good","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["366",{"pageContent":"quite a good system message so in most cases maybe you'll","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["367",{"pageContent":"you'll just want to leave it there but you know it's up to you","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["368",{"pageContent":"up to you in reality for this demo I don't need to use all of","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["369",{"pageContent":"to use all of this so I'm going to change it and mainly just to","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["370",{"pageContent":"just to show you how to change it okay we don't really","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["371",{"pageContent":"really meeting but then we can also see down here we have","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["372",{"pageContent":"here we have these you can see that we have like tools in here","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["373",{"pageContent":"in here and we have the description of our tools and and so on","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["374",{"pageContent":"and and so on and so on right this is basically all going to","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["375",{"pageContent":"all going to change to say say the same the only thing that's","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["376",{"pageContent":"that's going to change is this system message so we come","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["377",{"pageContent":"so we come down to here I'm going to change this message to","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["378",{"pageContent":"message to it's really short now just that right so we do","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["379",{"pageContent":"so we do conversational agent agent create prompt we pass","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["380",{"pageContent":"we pass it in our system message and we also need to pass in","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["381",{"pageContent":"to pass in any tools that we're using now I know the tools are","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["382",{"pageContent":"tools are already in here but this is basically resetting","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["383",{"pageContent":"resetting the prompt so we need to include any of the tools","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["384",{"pageContent":"of the tools that we are using in there as well it's not going","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["385",{"pageContent":"not going to just look at what was already in there and","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["386",{"pageContent":"in there and assume that we want them in there again okay so","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["387",{"pageContent":"okay so let's take a look at that all right so again pretty","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["388",{"pageContent":"pretty messy you can see that now the template for this","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["389",{"pageContent":"for this system message is shorter than the template for","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["390",{"pageContent":"for the user message is so pretty much the same in fact I","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["391",{"pageContent":"in fact I think it is exactly the same so there are a few","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["392",{"pageContent":"are a few inputs that we have here with the input so this is","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["393",{"pageContent":"so this is actually what the user is is writing the chat","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["394",{"pageContent":"the chat history and we have the agent scratch Pad chat","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["395",{"pageContent":"Pad chat history and we defined this earlier on right so","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["396",{"pageContent":"on right so this is going to connect up to our conversation","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["397",{"pageContent":"buffer window memory here so basically the the history of","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["398",{"pageContent":"history of the chart is going to go in there wherever it says","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["399",{"pageContent":"it says this we have an agent scratch pad that is is","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["400",{"pageContent":"that is is basically where the thoughts of the large","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["401",{"pageContent":"of the large language model are stored we can read them","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["402",{"pageContent":"read them because we set for both equal to true but the the","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["403",{"pageContent":"but the the final outputs will not include them okay cool so","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["404",{"pageContent":"okay cool so let's take a look at what we have in here so we","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["405",{"pageContent":"in here so we have three items we have the system message","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["406",{"pageContent":"message prompt template all right so these are all the","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["407",{"pageContent":"are all the prompts are being fed in there then we have the","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["408",{"pageContent":"we have the messages placeholder and you see this is where","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],["409",{"pageContent":"is where the chat history is going to go in right and then
